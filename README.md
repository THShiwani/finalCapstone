## US arrests data - PCA and cluster analysis

This project involved analysis of US arrests data. The dataset contained murder/assault/rape rates in 50 different cities in the US as well as the percentage of the population living in urban centres. The goal was to identify associations within the data using principal component analysis and K-means/hierachical clustering analysis.
