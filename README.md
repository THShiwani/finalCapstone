## US arrests data - PCA and cluster analysis

This project involved analysis of US arrests data - a dataset containing murder/assault/rape rates in 50 different cities in the US and the percentage of the population that lives in urban centres. The goal was to identify associations within the data using principal component analysis and K-means/hierachical clustering analysis.
